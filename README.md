> Pollution display and monitoring Android Project - Season of Code, MDG, IIT Roorkee

Link to the proposal: `https://drive.google.com/open?id=15wmNysGhOZIHenFqllj3JDDFUlFnq5sZ`

* The app will basically collect info of the user’s location. It will then monitor the pollution levels in the air around the user’s region.

* It will contain a map tile. The map tile API can be used to show the real-time Air Quality
index on a google, bing or openstreet map. It will indicate/mark various locations with
information about air index.

* It would do it by grabbing real time data from various monitoring agencies by using their
APIs.

* Also, if the route diversion is not possible, the app would book a taxi after asking for
a confirmation from the user if the user has the apps installed in the device.
